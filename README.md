## Intro

As a former maths teacher (25+ years ago!), I'm really enjoying this [Unity Maths and AI course](https://learn.unity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-beginners)

I'm looking forward to getting deeper into AI but also enjoying the "entry level" high-school and some first year university level maths

Before starting the course you do need to be familiar with Unity and switching between Unity GUI and Visual Studio, this is covered in https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials.
